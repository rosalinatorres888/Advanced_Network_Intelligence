> **Research Question:** Do structural patterns in academic literature correlate with organizational implementation challenges?

**Author:** Rosalina Torres  
**Institution:** Northeastern University, M.S. Data Analytics Engineering  
**Dataset:** 276 concepts extracted from 66 organizational behavior research papers  
**Network:** 5,115 weighted connections based on keyword co-occurrence

## 💭 The Story Behind This Project

*"Some keywords aren't frequent—but they're crucial connectors. Like people who aren't the loudest in the room, but hold things together."*

This project taught me that data science isn't just about algorithms—it's about revealing stories hidden in plain sight. Every network tells a story about how ideas connect, compete, and evolve. As someone who needs structure to concentrate when learning, building this tool helped me better understand my own learning patterns. The same principles that make academic concepts connect also apply to how teams collaborate and organizations innovate.

Working in sales taught me that the biggest challenges aren't technical—they're about bridging gaps between different worlds: customer needs and product capabilities, strategic vision and operational reality, human behavior and business outcomes. When I started analyzing academic literature networks, I realized these same gaps exist in how we structure knowledge itself.

What began as a curiosity about keyword relationships became a window into why organizations struggle with innovation, why new technologies get adopted poorly, and why the most important insights often come from the quiet connections we overlook.

## 🎯 Research Overview

This study applies network analysis to examine the structural relationships between concepts in organizational behavior literature. Using keyword co-occurrence data from 66 academic papers, I constructed a network of 276 concepts with 5,115 weighted connections to investigate knowledge structure patterns.

### Research Questions
1. What is the connectivity structure of concepts in organizational behavior literature?
2. Which concepts have disproportionate influence relative to their connections?
3. Are there systematic gaps between conceptually related but disconnected terms?
4. Do literature patterns correlate with documented organizational challenges?

## 📊 Methodology

### Data Collection
- **Source**: 66 peer-reviewed organizational behavior research papers
- **Extraction**: Keyword co-occurrence frequency analysis
- **Processing**: 276 unique concepts, cleaned and standardized
- **Network Construction**: Weighted undirected graph (minimum edge weight: 1)

### Analysis Framework
```python
# Core analysis pipeline
network = build_concept_network(co_occurrence_matrix)
centrality_metrics = calculate_centrality_measures(network)
community_structure = detect_communities(network)
gap_analysis = identify_weak_critical_links(network)
```

### Key Metrics
- **Network density**: 0.1348 (13.48% of possible connections exist)  
- **Connected components**: 1 (fully connected network)
- **Average degree**: 37.07 connections per concept
- **Clustering coefficient**: 0.624

## 🔍 Principal Findings

### 1. Network Structure Analysis

**Overall Connectivity:**
- Network exhibits single connected component (no isolated clusters)
- Density of 13.48% indicates moderate connectivity
- Average path length: 2.3 steps between any two concepts

**Centrality Distribution:**
- Power-law distribution in degree centrality
- High clustering around core management concepts
- Long tail of specialized concepts with few connections

### 2. Concept Influence Analysis

**Top 10 Concepts by PageRank Score:**

| Rank | Concept | PageRank Score | Degree | Influence/Connection Ratio |
|------|---------|---------------|---------|---------------------------|
| 1 | Management | 0.0646 | 234 | 0.000276 |
| 2 | Organizational | 0.0569 | 240 | 0.000237 |
| 3 | Behavior | 0.0229 | 140 | 0.000164 |
| 4 | Business | 0.0207 | 151 | 0.000137 |
| 5 | Industrial | 0.0195 | 156 | 0.000125 |
| 6 | Relations | 0.0153 | 87 | 0.000176 |
| 7 | Psychology | 0.0146 | 87 | 0.000168 |
| 8 | Decision | 0.0143 | 140 | 0.000102 |
| 9 | Making | 0.0135 | 135 | 0.000100 |
| 10 | Personnel | 0.0135 | 108 | 0.000125 |

### 3. Hidden Influencer Pattern

**Concepts with High Influence-to-Connection Ratios:**

| Concept | Connections | PageRank | Efficiency Ratio |
|---------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Customer | 32 | 0.0056 | 0.000175 |
| Product | 32 | 0.0056 | 0.000175 |
| Error | 13 | 0.0018 | 0.000138 |
| Violence | 16 | 0.0021 | 0.000131 |
| Options | 27 | 0.0036 | 0.000133 |

**Observation:** Several concepts demonstrate influence disproportionate to their connection count, suggesting potential undervaluation in the knowledge network.

### 4. Structural Gap Analysis

**Missing High-Impact Connections:**

| Concept Pair | Shared Neighbors | Direct Connection | Gap Significance |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Social ↔ Executive | 45 | None | High |
| Psychology ↔ Corporations | 27 | None | Medium |
| Psychology ↔ Corporate | 31 | None | Medium |
| Decision ↔ Motivation | 29 | None | Medium |

**Statistical Analysis:** Identified 12 concept pairs with 20+ shared neighbors but no direct connection, representing potential knowledge integration opportunities.

### 5. Connection Strength Distribution

**Weak Critical Links (Below Average Weight):**

| Connection | Weight | Average Weight | Relative Strength |
|------------|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Psychology ↔ Business | 1.0 | 2.1 | 48% below average |
| Decision ↔ Psychology | 1.0 | 2.1 | 48% below average |
| Executive ↔ Relations | 1.0 | 2.1 | 48% below average |
| Social ↔ Management | 1.2 | 2.1 | 43% below average |

## 📈 Empirical Correlations

### Literature-Practice Pattern Matching

To validate the predictive relevance of literature gaps, I examined documented organizational challenges:

**Case Study 1: Technology Adoption**
- **Literature Gap**: Psychology ↔ Business connection strength: 1.0
- **Organizational Pattern**: Reported difficulties in technology adoption initiatives
- **Correlation**: Organizations frequently cite "user resistance" and "change management" challenges

**Case Study 2: Strategic-Operational Alignment**
- **Literature Gap**: Social ↔ Executive missing direct connection (45 shared neighbors)
- **Organizational Pattern**: McKinsey reports 70% of strategic initiatives fail due to execution gaps
- **Correlation**: Documented communication breakdowns between leadership and operational teams

**Case Study 3: Customer-Centric Innovation**
- **Literature Gap**: Customer classified as "hidden influencer" (32 connections, high impact)
- **Organizational Pattern**: Harvard Business Review reports 95% of new products fail
- **Correlation**: Companies report difficulty translating customer insights into successful innovations
